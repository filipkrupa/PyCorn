# PyCorn
 Computer vision project for research in the field of AgricultureðŸ¤“
The idea was created by researchers at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, who struggled in the process of data segmentation. 
The project where I had the opportunity to help, was created to compare traditionally used manure with special BIO coal-based type. 
I used my old python skills to create a Pixel segmentation tool with the ability to automate the process for all the pictures they needed. 
The idea is to keep only green parts where corn is growing.
